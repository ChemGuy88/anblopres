This lab journal is for organizing my thoughts

## Things I want to do

The goal of this project is to do some statistical analyses. However, to do that we must process the data. Some possible benefits from this project is the option to generalize the methods to create an app so others can do this data processing at home with ease and convenience of doing it a time and place of their choosing.

- Comparisons
  - (All?) non-medication BP measurements with all medication measurements
  -  BP by time of day, where time of day is a cluster. Note that there might be several clusters as follows
     -  Morning
     -  Afternoon
     -  Evening
-  Data clean-up and processing
   -  Label observations that were done in an organized or intentional setting. For example:
      -  Doctor's office measurement
      -  Measurements I did at home for monitoring purposes (e.g., morning, afternoon, and evening measurements)
   -  Label observations by time of day, according to the cluster
   -  Label observations that occurred close to another event, e.g., after showering or an exercise.
